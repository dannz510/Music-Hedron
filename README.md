# Music-Hedron ðŸŽ¶âœ¨

Dive into an experimental web application that visualizes music or audio in a unique, geometric way. This project transforms sound into an interactive "hedron" that reacts and changes with the rhythm and dynamics of your audio input.

## About

"Music-Hedron" is a public repository by dannz510, designed to explore the fascinating intersection of audio processing and real-time graphics on the web. It's an artistic and technical demonstration of using web audio APIs and JavaScript to create a responsive, visually engaging experience tied to sound.

---

## Features

* **Audio Visualization:** Transforms incoming audio into dynamic geometric patterns.
* **Interactive Hedron:** A visually captivating shape that reacts to music.
* **Web-Based:** Runs directly in your browser, requiring no downloads or installations.
* **Real-time Processing:** Visualizations adapt instantly to changes in audio.

---

## Technologies Used

* **JavaScript:** The core of the application, handling audio processing (likely using Web Audio API), real-time calculations for the hedron's transformations, and rendering updates. Given its high percentage, it's central to both logic and potentially some rendering.
* **HTML:** Provides the basic structure of the web page, including the canvas element where the visualization is rendered.
* **CSS:** Styles the overall layout and any UI elements of the application.

## Files

The key files in this repository include:

* `index.html`: The main web page that loads the visualization.
* `script.js`: Contains all the JavaScript logic for audio input, processing, and rendering the "hedron" visualization.
* `style.css`: Defines the visual styling for the web page.
* `LICENSE`: Details the project's [MIT License](https://github.com/dannz510/Music-Hedron/blob/main/LICENSE).
* `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.
